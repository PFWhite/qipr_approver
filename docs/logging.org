* Scenario
We need to log all routes accessed so we can report that information.
When this is done we will be able to see where people went in their 
workflows and where they got stuck as well as what they did 

Sessions need to expire for this to work. Sessions should last 20min 17sec
* Implementation
Logging decorator, dynamic wrapping?

This decorator gets applied in the urls.py file dynamically. Note that this will
mutate the module so it is important to do this in the right order

Need a new model for the logs

| column name    | type        | purpose                                |
|----------------+-------------+----------------------------------------|
| id             | serial      | primary key                            |
| gatorlink      | foreign key | shows who did what                     |
| url            | text        | the url that was accessed              |
| ip             | ip type     | save the ip of the person who accessed |
| user agent     | var char    | user agent of the browser              |
| previous_log   | foreign key | the log we came from                   |
| time requested | datetime    | see when they did what they did        |
| time responded | datetime    | see when they did what they did        |
| http_verb      | varchar     | the http verb                          |
| post_data      | text        | json data of what was posted           |
| response_code  | varchar     | status code of response                |

User agent model. Auto fills in the has on save. Should not be able to 
edit hash

| col name  | types       | purpose                                      |
|-----------+-------------+----------------------------------------------|
| ua_string | text        | the string that was in the user agent header |
| ua_hash   | var char 32 | hash for the user agent for faster lookups   |

Decorator reads the request, builds the models, saves the models


* ToDo
- [X] AccessLog Model
- [X] UserAgent Model
- [X] Decorator attached
- [X] Adjacency
